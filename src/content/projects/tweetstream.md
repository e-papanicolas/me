I made this app using websockets as a way for users to stream tweets from Twitter **in real time**. Users were able to create a profile complete with profile picture uploads. The main feature is the event stream, where users filled out a form with an event name, and a hashtag to follow, as well as a streaming time which sets a timeout on the TwitterStream. Once the event page is loaded users can start streaming and all tweets matching the hashtag will be displayed on the screen as soon as they are recieved on the back end and broadcasted to the client. _Unfortunately due to the decline of Twitter, this app no longer works, but I am proud of the code I wrote for it!_
