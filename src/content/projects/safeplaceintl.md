I worked on this project @ [Tech Fleet](https://techfleet.org), a community led non-profit, where the client was the same non-profit I had previously won a hackathon project for, [Safeplace International](https://safeplaceinternational.org). I was the development team lead building a GraphQL API for the profile management feature of the virtual community for LGBTQ+ refugees who are graduates of SPI's The Dream Academy. Reconnecting with this project and cross-collaborating with design and product teams, was such a rewarding experience!
