A family collaboration, in the ideation and beginning of creation phase...

Our **vision** is to live in a world where ALL people have their basic needs met, are supported by their communities, and live in harmony with the natural environment.

Our **mission** is to create a platform for community members to safely and easily provide mutual aid, reducing waste and reliance on corporations.
