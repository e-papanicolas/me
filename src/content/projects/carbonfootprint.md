This group project was my **first collab!** and was created to give users a fun and easy way to get a snapshot of their personal carbon footprint. The app takes a look at some of the most common carbon emitting activities and provides user the ability to fill in their personal details and receive an estimate of carbon emissions based on data provided by the [Carbon Interface REST API](https://docs.carboninterface.com/#/?id=estimates-api). The data that powers the API is sourced from governments, non-profits, and leading researchers around the world including the EPA, GHG Protocol, and Environment Canada. The app is designed to create awareness by powering carbon measurement to combat climate change. _This is just a code example, but you can easily run this app locally with your own free [API key](https://www.carboninterface.com/users/sign_up)!_
