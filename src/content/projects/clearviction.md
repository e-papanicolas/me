I build tools that help reduce barriers for formerly incarcerated individuals, by helping streamline the process of vacating eligible convictions for folks in Washington State, thanks the passage of the [New Hope Act](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2890&Year=2017) in 2020. Right now I lead the dev-ops team and serve as CTO for the non-profit.
