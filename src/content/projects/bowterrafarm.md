This website was created for a farm in upstate NY that I worked on part time for the summer of 2024. Half of my time was spent working with the animals: chickens, ducks, quail, rabbits, a pig, and growing many different varieties of oyster mushrooms in an indoor environment. The other half of my time was spent creating this website with [Wix](https://wix.com/) -- my first time using a no code platform -- so that the farm could offer services and products in a more efficient manner, as well as share the message of permaculture and invite others to join the movement.
