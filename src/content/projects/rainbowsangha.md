I created this website for the **Rainbow Sangha**: a group of practicing spiritualists who seek to better understand ourselves and others. The Sangha is self-governing and all decisions (e.g., schedule changes, meeting topics, facilitator selections) are made democratically through group voting and discussion. All are welcome.
