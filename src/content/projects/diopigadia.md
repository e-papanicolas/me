I spent three amazing months living and working at this permaculture farm/community eco-village in the Peloponnese region of southern Greece in the winter of 2025 via [WWOOF](https://wwoof.net/). Most of my time was spent outdoors with the animals, working in the garden, or learning to build wood structures from other volunteers who were carpenters. This already existing [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) website was very content heavy and had been patchworked together over time by many different people and needed some first aid. 

⛑️ I cleaned up the backend by removing loads of unused and unpublished pages and posts, organized content and cleaned up titles so that it would be easier to move forward. 

⛑️ I added new content, new pages, aligned the navigation of the Greek version to the English version and completely reworked the Greek version so that both sites matched each other. 

⛑️ I created guides for how to edit and publish content in the proper way so that anyone working on the website in the future could do it in a streamlined manner.
