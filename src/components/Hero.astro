        I love to travel and spend time outdoors, especially exploring mountains, forests, and beaches.
        <br><br>
        My hobbies include reading, playing with cats, local volunteering, spending time with friends, watching sci fi, taking care of house plants, drinking ethically sourced coffee, and reducing my carbon and plastic footprints. I am a great cook, and I enjoy making meals with fresh vegetables from local farms.

        In the last few years, I have transitioned from the restaurant industry into software development, designing and creating websites and software applications after working as a server, bartender, and manager/team lead for over 15 years.

        I am interested in learning more about permaculture/gardening, natural house building, and other ways of living in greater balance with nature.
