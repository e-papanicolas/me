        I love to travel and spend time outdoors, especially exploring mountains, forests, and beaches. My hobbies include reading, playing with cats, local volunteering, spending time with friends, watching sci fi, taking care of house plants, drinking ethically sourced coffee, and reducing my carbon and plastic footprints. I am a great cook, and I enjoy making meals with fresh vegetables from local farms.

        A few years ago, I transitioned from the restaurant industry into software development, designing and creating websites and software applications after working as a server, bartender, and manager/team lead for over 15 years. As part of my self-taught learning experience, I volunteered my time working on various social justice projects.
        <br><br>
        After deciding that a life in front of a computer was also not something I truly desired, I decided to leave the US — the epicenter of capitalism and global imperialism, and a failing democracy — in search of a different kind of life. Right now you can find me volunteering on different organic farms, community projects, and eco-villages. 
        <br><br>
        In my ideal world I would love to meet people from all over the world and help to unite us all together, the people, without borders and nationalism, and help end capitalism which is killing us and our planet.

        I value honesty, teamwork, and kindness, and I support social justice movements around the world fighting for equality. I try to focus on the positive in every situation and I love making people laugh and smile.

        I am interested in learning more about permaculture and gardening, natural house building, and other ways of living in greater balance with nature, community living and being part of the sustainable, self sufficiency movement.
